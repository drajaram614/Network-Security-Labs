# Network Security Labs

This repository contains a series of Network Security labs that I created using Virtual Machines, Docker Containers and Wireshark. These labs provide me with hands-on experience with various network security concepts, including TCP attacks, packet sniffing, spoofing, ARP cache poisoning, and firewall configurations. I also focus on cryptography in these labs, specifically TLS.

## Lab Summaries

- **[TCP Attacks Lab](https://github.com/drajaram614/Network-Security-Labs/blob/main/TCP%20Attacks%20Lab.md)**
  - In this lab, I learned about TCP-based attacks such as SYN flooding and TCP session hijacking.

- **[Packet Sniffing and Spoofing Lab](https://github.com/drajaram614/Network-Security-Labs/blob/main/Packet%20Sniffing%20Spoofing%20Lab.md)**
  - This lab covers packet sniffing using tools like Wireshark and demonstrates how to spoof packets on a network.

- **[Firewall (iptables) Lab](https://github.com/drajaram614/Network-Security-Labs/blob/main/Firewall%20(iptables)%20Lab.md)**
  - I learned how to configure and use iptables to set up firewall rules for network security.

## Cryptography Lab

- **[Cryptography](Cryptography.md)**
  - In this cryptography lab, I explored different cryptographic attacks, including Cipher-text Only, Chosen-Plaintext, and Known-Plaintext attacks, to understand how attackers leverage available information to break encryption. I also practiced various encryption techniques, such as Caesar Cipher, Vigen√®re Cipher, and RSA key generation, along with applying block cipher modes of operation and Diffie-Hellman key exchange to reinforce my knowledge of secure communication methods.

## TLS Lab

- **[TLS](TLS.md)**
    - In this TLS lab, I analyzed SSL/TLS traffic using Wireshark and inspect website security details through browser tools, focusing on TLS versions, cipher suites, and certificate information. I also explored key concepts like HMAC vs. digital signatures, Certificate Transparency, and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).
