# Network Security Labs

This repository contains a series of Network Security labs. These labs provide hands-on experience with various network security concepts, including firewalls, cryptography, and TLS.

## Cryptography Lab

- **[Cryptography](Cryptography.md)**
  - In this cryptography lab, I explored different cryptographic attacks, including Cipher-text Only, Chosen-Plaintext, and Known-Plaintext attacks, to understand how attackers leverage available information to break encryption. I also practiced various encryption techniques, such as Caesar Cipher, Vigen√®re Cipher, and RSA key generation, along with applying block cipher modes of operation and Diffie-Hellman key exchange to reinforce my knowledge of secure communication methods.

## TLS Lab

- **[TLS](TLS.md)**
    - In this TLS lab, I analyzed SSL/TLS traffic using Wireshark and inspect website security details through browser tools, focusing on TLS versions, cipher suites, and certificate information. I also explored key concepts like HMAC vs. digital signatures, Certificate Transparency, and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).
