# Network Security Labs

This repository contains a series of Network Security labs using Virtual Machines and Wireshark. These labs provide hands-on experience with various network security concepts, including TCP attacks, packet sniffing, spoofing, ARP cache poisoning, and firewall configurations. The labs also include a focus on cryptography, specifically TLS.

## Lab Summaries

- **[TCP Attacks Lab](Lab1_TCP_Attacks.md)**
  - In this lab, you'll learn about TCP-based attacks such as SYN flooding and TCP session hijacking.

- **[Packet Sniffing and Spoofing Lab](Lab2_Packet_Sniffing_Spoofing.md)**
  - This lab covers packet sniffing using tools like Wireshark and demonstrates how to spoof packets on a network.

- **[Firewall (iptables) Lab](Lab4_Firewall_iptables.md)**
  - Learn how to configure and use iptables to set up firewall rules for network security.

## Cryptography Lab

- **[Cryptography](Cryptography.md)**
  - In this cryptography lab, I explored different cryptographic attacks, including Cipher-text Only, Chosen-Plaintext, and Known-Plaintext attacks, to understand how attackers leverage available information to break encryption. I also practiced various encryption techniques, such as Caesar Cipher, Vigen√®re Cipher, and RSA key generation, along with applying block cipher modes of operation and Diffie-Hellman key exchange to reinforce my knowledge of secure communication methods.

## TLS Lab

- **[TLS](TLS.md)**
  - This lab focuses on Transport Layer Security (TLS), covering key protocols and their role in securing communications.
