# Network Security Labs

This repository contains a series of Network Security labs using Virtual Machines and Wireshark. These labs provide hands-on experience with various network security concepts, including TCP attacks, packet sniffing, spoofing, ARP cache poisoning, and firewall configurations. The labs also include a focus on cryptography, specifically TLS.

## Lab Summaries

- **Lab 1: [TCP Attacks Lab](Lab1_TCP_Attacks.md)**
  - In this lab, you'll learn about TCP-based attacks such as SYN flooding and TCP session hijacking.

- **Lab 2: [Packet Sniffing and Spoofing Lab](Lab2_Packet_Sniffing_Spoofing.md)**
  - This lab covers packet sniffing using tools like Wireshark and demonstrates how to spoof packets on a network.

- **Lab 3: [ARP Cache Poisoning Attack Lab](Lab3_ARP_Cache_Poisoning.md)**
  - Explore the ARP cache poisoning attack, where attackers can redirect traffic by manipulating ARP tables.

- **Lab 4: [Firewall (iptables) Lab](Lab4_Firewall_iptables.md)**
  - Learn how to configure and use iptables to set up firewall rules for network security.

## Cryptography Lab

- **[TLS](Cryptography_TLS.md)**
  - This lab focuses on Transport Layer Security (TLS), covering key protocols and their role in securing communications.
